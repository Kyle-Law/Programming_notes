I have a very structured way of learning new languages, I code a semi-advanced system. The same system over and over again. It's a World of Warcraft community site. The requirements usually look like this:

1) Users with authentication

2) Authorization using roles & permissions architecture

3) CMS - Functionality like pages and site-building

4) Comments with real-time notifications

5) Forums with real-time subscriptions per thread

6) Notification functionality

7) API module for talking with Blizzards servers

8) Chat functionality

9) Event and booking functionality

10) Monitoring functionality

11) Error logging

12) Mail system

13) Admin backend

The important thing is to build everything from scratch and with an architecture that makes sense for the language. It works great for me because I know the ins and outs of building such a system and it is quite fun to see where programming language x outperforms language y and so on. And it is easier to re-wire your brain if what you are building is something you are familiar with.
